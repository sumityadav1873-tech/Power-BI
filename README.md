# ShopNest stands as the leading department store in the e-commerce marketplace in Portugal. It serves as a digital bridge connecting small businesses to customers across the country, enabling merchants to showcase and sell products with direct shipment facilitated by ShopNest’s logistics partners.
The provided data consists of authentic commercial information across 9 datasets. My task was to design and develop an interactive Power BI dashboard that answers key business query related to sales performance, delivery efficiency, customer payment preferences, product ratings, and revenue trends.
In this project, I designed and developed an interactive Power BI dashboard for ShopNest Store, using 9 anonymized real-world e-commerce datasets. The goal was to provide business insights into sales performance, revenue trends, customer behavior, product ratings, and delivery efficiency.
What I did in this project:
📂 Data Preparation
- Collected and integrated 9 different datasets (customers, orders, products, sellers, payments, reviews, etc.).
- Cleaned and transformed raw data using Power Query.
- Built a relational data model by creating relationships across datasets.

Data Analysis
- Created DAX measures such as Total Revenue, Delayed Orders, On-time Orders, and Average Ratings.
- Defined business rules (e.g., delayed orders = actual delivery date > estimated delivery date).
- Dashboard Development
- Designed visualizations to answer 8 key business questions:

Top categories by sales
- Number of delayed orders by product category
- Monthly comparison of delayed vs. on-time orders
- Customer payment method analysis
- Top 10 & bottom 10 rated products
- State-wise sales analysis
- Seasonal sales patterns (quarterly trends)
- Revenue trends over time
- Applied drillthrough filters for deeper insights.
- Used a mix of bar charts, pie charts, and line charts for effective storytelling.

📌Insights & Business Value
- Identified top-performing categories and states contributing to sales.
- Highlighted logistics issues through delayed order analysis.
- Found that credit cards are the most preferred payment method.
- Revealed customer satisfaction levels by comparing top and bottom-rated products.
- Uncovered seasonal demand trends and overall revenue growth patterns.
